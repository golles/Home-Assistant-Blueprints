blueprint:
  name: Motion-activated light profiles based on time and light level and with a grace period.
  description: |
    This motion-activated blueprint allows you to setup automatic light switching like the Philips Hue motion 
    sensors do. When motion is detected, the light will be turned on, when the motion is no longer detected,
    the lights will go to another state for a given amount of seconds before switching off.
    This allows anyone to not be left in the dark, you will be warned before the light switches off.

    This automation does require to setup light profiles, a light profile contains the color (in xy), birghtness 
    and a transition time. This makes the automation much simpler plus it allows you to maintain these states in a 
    general place. For more information about light profiles, you could check the documentation 
    https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/light/
    This automation should work with any lights, motion sensors and illuminance sensors.
