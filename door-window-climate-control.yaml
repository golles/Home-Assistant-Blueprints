blueprint:
  name: Door/window based climate control
  description: |
    This blueprint will set the hvac mode of a climate entity based on the state of a door or window (or any other binary_sensor).
    When it's open (binary_sensor on) hvac mode is set to off.
    When it's close (binary_sensor off) hvac mode is set to auto.
